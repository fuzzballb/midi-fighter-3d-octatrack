# midi-fighter-3d-octatrack
Arduino code to make the Midi Fighter 3d work with Octatrack slices and slots, by playing the notes two octaves lower.

For slices (choped up sample) use PROJ -> MIDI -> CONROL-> AUDIO NOTE IN : FOLLOW IN and create a slice grid from your sample

For slots (individual samples on different tracks), use PROJ -> MIDI -> CONROL-> AUDIO NOTE IN : MAP/TRACK put samples on your tracks, and select the first track while recording
